Create a complete “Blog Admin” page for my Knit by Machine site.
This will NOT use a CMS yet; all posts should be stored as JSON files in my project.
Keep everything simple, clean, and easy for me to use as I build content.

Here is exactly what I need:

1. Create a Blog Admin page

Build an HTML page at:
/admin/blog.html

This page should allow me to:

create new blog posts

edit existing blog posts

delete posts

save posts as JSON files

upload post images manually to /public/images/blog/

The form should include these fields:

title (text)

date (YYYY-MM-DD — auto-fill today’s date)

category (text input or dropdown; don’t hardcode options)

tags (comma-separated text input)

heroImage (text input for the URL, example: /images/blog/my-photo.webp)

content (a large textarea using Markdown, not HTML)

I will paste the image paths manually after uploading images into /public/images/blog/.

Please do NOT try to handle image uploading automatically.
Just allow text fields for the image URLs.

2. Data storage as JSON files

Save each blog post as a separate JSON file inside:

/src/content/blog/

The filename should be:

{slug}.json

Slug rules:

based on the title

lowercase

spaces → hyphens

remove special characters

example:
Title: “Back to Basics: Revisiting Increases”
Slug: back-to-basics-revisiting-increases

3. JSON schema (use exactly this structure)

Each JSON file must use this structure:

{
  "title": "",
  "slug": "",
  "date": "",
  "description": "",
  "category": "",
  "tags": [],
  "heroImage": "",
  "content": "",
  "images": []
}


Notes:

description is auto-generated from the first 160 characters of the Markdown content, unless I enter one manually in the admin form.

tags should be an array, created from splitting the comma-separated list.

images is optional — leave it as an empty array for now, but allow the admin UI to add more image paths in the future.

4. Markdown handling

The admin page should save raw Markdown text into the JSON content field.

In the front-end blog pages:

Markdown will be parsed into HTML using Astro’s Markdown utilities.

You do NOT need to build the front-end here — just ensure JSON stores Markdown cleanly.

5. Image usage rules

Do NOT attempt image uploading inside the admin tool.

I’ll upload images manually to:

public/images/blog/

The admin page should:

include a text field for heroImage

show an example path

NOT require absolute URLs

allow any relative path like:
/images/blog/myphoto.webp

6. Blog Post List View (inside the admin)

At the top of the admin page, display:

a list of existing blog posts (read from src/content/blog/)

each row should show: title, date, slug

an Edit button

a Delete button

Delete should require confirmation.

7. Blog Post Editor UI Requirements

The editor should:

load existing JSON into the form

allow me to update any field

regenerate the slug only if the title changes

save back to the same JSON file

Use clean, modern HTML and basic CSS only — no frameworks.

8. Notes about Markdown + JSON

Markdown inside JSON should be:

stored as a plain string

not escaped weirdly

preserved exactly as typed

safe for Astro Markdown parsing later

9. Keep everything modular and easy to expand

I will expand this admin system later as I add a CMS.
Keep the code readable, well-commented, and organized.

10. Final Output

Please output:

the full HTML file for /admin/blog.html

any companion JS or CSS (inline or external — your choice)

an example JSON file created by the admin

instructions on where each file should be placed inside my project structure

Make everything copy-and-paste ready.
