          <h2>Will I still have have access to Sue?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes. You’ll still have <strong>direct access to me</strong> for help, questions, and guidance.
            Even as Knit It Now winds down, you are not losing support — I’ll be here every step of the way.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>What happens to my current Knit It Now membership?</h2>
          <p>
            Your membership remains active through your paid term. After that, you can continue
            month-to-month or move to Knit by Machine when you're ready.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>Will I lose access to my purchased courses?</h2>
          <p>
            You will keep access for the remaining life of Knit It Now. If you depend on a specific course or
            download, I can help you find comparable resources on Knit by Machine.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>Knit by Machine doesn’t have as much content yet. How will I get the help I need?</h2>
          <p>
            KBM is brand new and growing quickly, but you still have me. I’ll guide you directly as you knit,
            and I’ll prioritize new KBM tools and resources based on what you tell me you need most.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>Will I get access to Knit by Machine?</h2>
          <p>
            Many Knit It Now members will receive complimentary access so you can make the transition comfortably.
          </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>What if there’s a tool or tutorial I rely on?</h2>
          <p>
            Reach out and let me know. I will help you locate it, replace it, or work around it — you won’t be left
            without support.
          </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>Who should I contact with questions?</h2>

            Me. You can continue to reach out directly and I’ll help you personally.
