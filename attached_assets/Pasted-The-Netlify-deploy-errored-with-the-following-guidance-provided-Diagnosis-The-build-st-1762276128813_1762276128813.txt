The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis**  
- The build stops when Vite reports an unresolved asset: [line 85](#L85) shows the Vite build error, and [lines 87-90](#L87-L90) explain that `/envelope.png` could not be resolved during the build. This missing asset causes the build to exit with code 1.

**Solution**  
1. Check the repository for the referenced image. Ensure that `envelope.png` actually exists and has been committed to the project (for Astro, static assets should live in `astro-site/public/`).  
2. If the file exists, confirm the path used in the Astro/HTML template matches its location—for example, if the file is under `public/images/envelope.png`, reference it as `/images/envelope.png`.  
3. If the file was intentionally removed, update or remove the `<img>` (or CSS background) reference so it points to a valid asset.
