The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis**

- Netlify runs `npm run build`, but the repository root lacks `package.json`, causing npm to fail to start the build ([lines 44-49](#L44-L49)).

**Solution**

- Make sure the project’s `package.json` (and any associated lock file) is committed to the repository root so Netlify can find the build script. If the Node project lives in a subdirectory (e.g., `app/` or `site/`), either move the `package.json` to the root or configure Netlify’s “Base directory” setting to that folder so `npm run build` executes where the file lives.
- If this site is purely static HTML/CSS with no build step, remove the `npm run build` command in the Netlify UI and set the publish directory to the folder holding the static assets (for example `public/` or `dist/`), allowing Netlify to deploy the files directly.
