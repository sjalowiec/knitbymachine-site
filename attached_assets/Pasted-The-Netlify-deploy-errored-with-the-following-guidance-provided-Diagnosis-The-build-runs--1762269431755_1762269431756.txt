The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Diagnosis  
- The build runs `npm run build`, but npm cannot find `/package.json`, so the command fails with `ENOENT` ([lines 45-49](#L45-L49)). This indicates the Netlify build is executing in a directory that does not contain a `package.json`.

Solution  
1. In your repository, confirm where `package.json` actually lives (e.g., root, `app/`, `frontend/`, etc.).  
2. Update Netlify to run the build from that directory: either  
   - Set the “Base directory” in the Netlify UI to the folder containing `package.json`, or  
   - Add a `netlify.toml` with the correct base/command, for example (adjust the folder names to match your project):  
     ```toml
     [build]
       base = "frontend"
       command = "npm run build"
       publish = "frontend/dist"
     ```  
3. If the file truly is missing, add/commit the `package.json` to the repo so the build can install dependencies and run the script.
