I want to build a Skill Builder system for my site Knit by Machine using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks or Bootstrap.

I already have a complete HTML/CSS/JS prototype (below).
Use that file as the template for how each Skill Builder should look and function.

🔧 What I want Replit to create:
1. File Structure
/public/
  /skillbuilders/
    increase.html
    increase.json
  /media/skillbuilders/increase/
    (GIFs or short clips)
/admin/
  skillbuilder-admin.html
/js/
  skillbuilder.js

2. Purpose

I want to separate content (in JSON) from the template layout so new Skill Builders can be created easily.

Each Skill Builder page (like increase.html) should load its data dynamically from a JSON file.

The admin page (skillbuilder-admin.html) will let me enter data in form fields, preview the result, and export a JSON file.

🧱 Front-End Template (use my provided HTML)

Keep my design, layout, colors, and CSS rules exactly as written.

Add minimal JavaScript that:

Loads JSON (e.g., /public/skillbuilders/increase.json) and fills in:

Title

Intro text

Tagline

Checklist items

Steps (title, duration, description, tips, media)

Reflection prompts

Related “Next Steps” cards

Saves user progress (steps tried, notes, reactions) to localStorage using the Skill Builder ID as a prefix.

Keeps all interactivity (checklist modal, “Mark tried,” progress bar, reactions, confetti).

🧩 JSON Schema
{
  "id": "increase",
  "title": "Increase Skill Builder",
  "intro": "Practice four ways to add stitches...",
  "tagline": "You will learn more by doing than by watching.",
  "preChecklist": ["Yarn ready", "Cast-on comb", "Tension set", "Notebook nearby"],
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Transfer (edge increase)",
      "duration": "~10 sec",
      "description": "Work 10 rows. Transfer one stitch outward to an empty needle to add a stitch while keeping a clean edge.",
      "tips": ["Use a 1-prong tool so the edge stays tidy.", "Move the stitch away from the edge before knitting the next row."],
      "mediaType": "gif",
      "mediaFile": "increase-transfer.gif"
    }
  ],
  "reflectionPrompts": ["What did you notice?", "Which method do you prefer for edges vs center shaping?"],
  "nextSteps": [
    {"title": "Decrease Skill Builder", "link": "#"},
    {"title": "Magic Formula Wizard", "link": "#"},
    {"title": "Glossary: Increase", "link": "#"}
  ]
}

🧮 Admin Page Requirements (skillbuilder-admin.html)

Pure HTML/CSS/JS form (no Bootstrap).

Form fields for each JSON property:

Text inputs: id, title, intro, tagline

Checklist (array builder)

Steps (repeater fields with “Add Step,” “Add Tip”)

Reflection prompts

Next Steps (title + link)

Buttons:

Preview → renders the Skill Builder in a live preview area using the template layout.

Export JSON → generates a downloadable .json file.

Optional: “Import JSON” → load an existing file for editing.

Style it to match my existing KBM color palette:

Green: #52682D

Olive: #738C52

Gray: #f6f7f8

Rounded corners: 14px

🧰 Shared JS File (skillbuilder.js)

Functions to:

Load and render Skill Builder data.

Save/restore localStorage values.

Handle checklist modal and progress updates.

Run confetti animation (use my existing function).

✅ Goals

Allow me to create new Skill Builders by filling out a form (admin page) and exporting JSON.

Each Skill Builder HTML file will automatically render from its corresponding JSON.

The look and interactivity should match the prototype exactly.

No frameworks or external libraries — only my CSS and vanilla JS.

🧾 Notes for Replit

Keep HTML readable and semantic (use <section>, <article>, <details>).

Use consistent ARIA labeling and focus order.

Include comments in JS for clarity.

Don’t include <head> tags or meta content in generated fragments — I’ll integrate those later into my Astro project.

The final deliverable:

A working example Skill Builder (increase.html + increase.json)

A fully functional admin editor (skillbuilder-admin.html)

A shared JS utility (skillbuilder.js)
