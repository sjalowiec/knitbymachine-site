  "body": "<p>If you've been tempted to skip the gauge swatch and dive straight into your project, you're not alone. But understanding gauge is one of the most important skills you can develop as a machine knitter.</p>\n\n<h2>What Is Gauge?</h2>\n\n<p>Gauge refers to the number of <strong>stitches and rows per inch</strong> in your knitted fabric. It's determined by your yarn weight, tension setting, and needle size. Even small variations in gauge can dramatically affect your finished project's size.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Swatches Matter</h2>\n\n<p>A 10% difference in gauge can turn a size medium into a size large. For a sweater with a 40-inch chest measurement, that's 4 inches of difference—enough to completely change the fit.</p>\n\n<h3>Real-World Example</h3>\n\n<p>Pattern calls for: <strong>5 stitches per inch</strong><br>\nYour actual gauge: <strong>4.5 stitches per inch</strong><br>\nPattern width: 200 stitches (should be 40 inches)<br>\nYour actual width: 44.4 inches (4.4 inches too wide!)</p>\n\n<h2>How to Make a Proper Gauge Swatch</h2>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Cast on at least 40 stitches</strong> — Wider swatches give more accurate measurements</li>\n  <li><strong>Knit at least 40 rows</strong> — You need enough fabric to measure accurately</li>\n  <li><strong>Remove from the machine</strong> — Fabric relaxes off the needles</li>\n  <li><strong>Let it rest for 30 minutes</strong> — Allows the fabric to settle</li>\n  <li><strong>Measure in the center</strong> — Edges can be distorted</li>\n  <li><strong>Count stitches and rows</strong> — Use a ruler and count over 4 inches</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Common Gauge Mistakes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Measuring while the fabric is still on the machine</li>\n  <li>Making swatches that are too small</li>\n  <li>Not washing/blocking the swatch if you'll wash the final garment</li>\n  <li>Measuring at the edges instead of the center</li>\n  <li>Forgetting to account for different stitch patterns (lace, tuck, Fair Isle)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Quick Tips</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Pro tip:</strong> Label your swatches with the yarn, tension setting, and stitch pattern. Keep them in a binder for future reference. You'll build a personal gauge library that saves time on future projects.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>What to Do When Gauge Is Off</h2>\n\n<p>If your gauge doesn't match the pattern:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Too many stitches per inch?</strong> Loosen your tension</li>\n  <li><strong>Too few stitches per inch?</strong> Tighten your tension</li>\n  <li><strong>Still not matching?</strong> Adjust your calculations to match YOUR gauge</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Remember: It's easier to adjust tension than to rip out an entire garment. Take the time to swatch—your future self will thank you!</p>",
