  "body": "<p>Every machine knitter has faced the dreaded dropped stitch. Whether you're a beginner or experienced knitter, understanding why stitches drop and how to fix them quickly can save your projects and your sanity.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Stitches Drop</h2>\n\n<p>Dropped stitches happen when a loop slips off a needle and starts to ladder down through your fabric. Common causes include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Tension too tight or too loose</strong> — Improper tension is the #1 cause</li>\n  <li><strong>Damaged needles</strong> — Bent or worn needle latches don't close properly</li>\n  <li><strong>Yarn catching</strong> — Snagging on the carriage or gates</li>\n  <li><strong>Rushing the carriage</strong> — Moving too fast doesn't allow latches to close</li>\n  <li><strong>Old or poor quality yarn</strong> — Weak or slubby yarn can break or slip</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Prevention Strategies</h2>\n\n<h3>1. Check Your Tension</h3>\n\n<p>Proper tension is critical. Your yarn should feed smoothly without being too tight (which stresses the needles) or too loose (which creates sloppy stitches that slip off easily).</p>\n\n<h3>2. Inspect Your Needles Regularly</h3>\n\n<p>Run your finger along the needle bed. Feel for needles that are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bent or raised higher than others</li>\n  <li>Stuck in position</li>\n  <li>Have damaged latches</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Replace problem needles immediately—they're not expensive and they'll save you hours of frustration.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Move the Carriage Smoothly</h3>\n\n<p>Consistent, steady carriage movement gives needle latches time to close properly. Jerky or rushed movements are a recipe for dropped stitches.</p>\n\n<h2>Quick Fix: The Latch Tool Method</h2>\n\n<p>When you catch a dropped stitch early, you can fix it in seconds:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Stop knitting immediately</strong> — Don't move the carriage</li>\n  <li><strong>Locate the dropped stitch</strong> — It will be at the bottom of a ladder</li>\n  <li><strong>Insert your latch tool through the loop</strong> from front to back</li>\n  <li><strong>Hook the first ladder bar</strong> and pull it through the loop</li>\n  <li><strong>Repeat up the ladder</strong> until you reach the needle</li>\n  <li><strong>Place the stitch back on the needle</strong> — Make sure the latch is closed</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Important:</strong> Always work from the bottom (dropped stitch) up to the top (current row). Working backwards will twist your stitches.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>When the Damage Is Severe</h2>\n\n<p>If a stitch has laddered down more than 10-15 rows, or if you didn't notice it right away, you have options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Partial unraveling</strong> — Take the work off the machine, unravel to the problem area, and rehang</li>\n  <li><strong>Duplicate stitch repair</strong> — For small areas, you can hand-stitch over the dropped section</li>\n  <li><strong>Embrace it</strong> — In textured or lace patterns, a small irregularity may not be noticeable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>\n\n<p>Drop a stitch intentionally on a practice swatch. Practice picking it up with your latch tool until the motion becomes automatic. When it happens on a real project, you'll be ready!</p>\n\n<p>Remember: Even the most experienced knitters drop stitches occasionally. The difference is knowing how to fix them quickly and move on.</p>",
