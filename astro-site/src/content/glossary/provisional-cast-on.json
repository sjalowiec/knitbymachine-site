  "description": "A temporary cast-on that allows live stitches to be picked up and worked later. It’s often used when both edges of the knitting will be joined or finished in a special way.\n\nIn machine knitting, the scrap ’n ravel method serves the same purpose—creating a removable starting edge with scrap yarn and a ravel cord.\n\nThis method is useful for hems, collars, or bands where stitches will later be knitted in the opposite direction or grafted.",
  "tooltip": "A temporary cast-on that lets you pick up live stitches later.",
  "example": "Use a provisional cast-on for a scarf that will be grafted end to end.",
