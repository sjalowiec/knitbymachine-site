  "description": "A popular cast-on method using scrap yarn (waste yarn) and a ravel cord before beginning with the garment yarn.\n\nSteps:\n\nCast on with scrap yarn.\n\nKnit several rows.\n\nKnit one row of ravel cord.\n\nBegin knitting with your garment yarn.\n\nThis technique protects delicate yarn from the cast-on comb, provides a stable base for hanging weights, and is ideal for hung hems or any project where the starting edge will be finished later.\n\nIn hand knitting, this is similar to a provisional cast-on.",
