  "description": "Tension refers to how tightly or loosely the yarn is knitted. It directly affects gauge, fabric feel, and fit.\n\nOn a knitting machine, tension is adjusted by the tension dial on the carriage. A lower number produces tighter knitting (smaller stitches), while a higher number produces looser knitting (larger stitches).\n\nEven slight changes in yarn thickness, fiber, or weather conditions can affect tension—so always knit and measure a swatch before starting your project.",
  "tooltip": "How tight or loose the knitting is, adjusted by the tension dial on the machine.",
  "example": "Try knitting a swatch at tension 6, then at tension 7 to see the difference in stitch size.",
