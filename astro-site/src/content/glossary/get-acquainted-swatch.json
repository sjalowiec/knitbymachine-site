  "description": "Also known as a tension test strip, this is a single piece of knitting that includes several tension settings. It’s used to quickly compare fabric feel, drape, and gauge without knitting multiple swatches.\n\nKnit a few rows at one tension, change the tension dial setting, and knit a few more rows—label each section as you go. This quick test helps you choose the best tension for your yarn and project before knitting a full swatch.",
  "tooltip": "A test strip with multiple tension settings to compare fabric feel and gauge.",
  "example": "Knit 20 rows each at tensions 6, 7, and 8 to decide which setting produces the best fabric.",
