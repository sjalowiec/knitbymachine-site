  "description": "A swatch is a small sample of knitting used to measure gauge and test fabric characteristics before starting a project.\n\nMachine knitters use swatches to check:\n• Stitch and row gauge\n• Yarn behavior (shrinkage, drape, or stretch)\n• Tension settings and finishing effects\n\nAlways record your stitch and row counts, the tension dial setting, and any notes about the yarn. A properly measured and labeled swatch helps ensure your finished project matches the intended size and fit.",
