  "description": "A smooth, strong cord used between sections of knitting to make stitches easy to separate later.\n\nMachine knitters often use a ravel cord when casting on, creating hems, or dividing sections of knitting. The smooth surface prevents fibers from snagging, allowing the cord to pull out cleanly after knitting.\n\nChoose a bright color that contrasts with your yarn so it’s easy to see and remove. Nylon cords are especially popular for their strength and smoothness.",
  "tooltip": "Smooth cord used to separate sections of knitting—pulls out easily when no longer needed.",
  "example": "Scrap and Ravel: Knit a few rows of scrap yarn, knit 1 row of ravel cord, continue with main yarn.",
